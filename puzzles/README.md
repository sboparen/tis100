These were my entries for the TIS-100 puzzle design contest.

There are fifteen puzzles, each of which falls into one of three series:

**Quantum Entanglement Series:**
The left and right half of the segment have been disconnected,
and can only communicate through stack memory nodes.

**Computational Limits Series:**
These puzzles are meant to require complex solutions, which should
make cycle optimization quite labour intensive.

**Implementation Dependent Series:**
Puzzles which abuse behaviour specific to the game's implementation.
I believe that each of these puzzles has a valid implementation on
which it is unsolvable.

**UPDATE:**
The intended solution to EVERETT CALIBRATOR stopped working when
testing behaviour was improved in the final version of TIS-100.
This is a good thing!  However, if you want to try the puzzle as
it was originally intended, the version here has been modified to
make all of the fixed test cases the same.
