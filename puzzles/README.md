These were my entries for the TIS-100 puzzle design contest.

There are fifteen puzzles, each of which falls into one of three series:

**Quantum Entanglement Series:**
The left and right half of the segment have been disconnected,
and can only communicate through stack memory nodes.

**Computational Limits Series:**
These puzzles are meant to require complex solutions, which should
make cycle optimization quite labour intensive.

**Implementation Dependent Series:**
Puzzles which abuse behaviour specific to the game's implementation.
I believe that each of these puzzles has a valid implementation on
which it is unsolvable.
